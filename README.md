A Convolutional Neural Network Model to determine rock, paper, and scissors hand gesture

This is my first Machine Learning model on Image Classification. This model is trained using rockpaperscissors dataset provided by Julien de la Bru√®re-Terreault. The dataset contains 2188 pictures of rock, paper, and scissors gesture. You can access the dataset on

This model is made using Tensorflow Keras with Sequential model with 2D Convolution and Max Pooling.
